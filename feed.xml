I replaced the screen but lost the fingerprint reader functionality in the process. To unlock my phone anymore I had to use a pin, and after unlocking the phone over and over my screen was developing smudges in place of the PIN numbers. <strike>Android</strike> <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a> has a function to “Scramble PIN input layout” within the Security tab of the Settings app, directly addressing my smudging problem. After a bajillion scrambles of my PIN pattern making various Tetris-shapes, I started to wonder, how often does this happen?</p> <h3 id="what-defines-a-tetris-shape">What defines a Tetris-shape?</h3> <div class="img_row"> <img class="col three" src="/assets/pin/5tetrominoes.svg"/> </div> <p>By Tetris-shape I mean tetromino. “A tetromino is a geometric shape composed of four squares, connected orthogonally” - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetromino">Wikipedia</a>.

To make a shape you need 4 <em>different</em> numbers. If any repeat you couldn’t make the 4th square. That said, there are 10 x 9 x 8 x 7 (<em>10P4</em>), or 5,040 possible non-repeating PIN numbers. This is an important assumption.</p> <p>Since each shape is a set of 4 numbers, there are 4! or 24 possible permutations of that set that can create that shape. If we consider the other 42 orientations, there are 42*4! or 1,008 sets of 4 numbers that can create a tetromino.</p> <p>Using some rough maths, we can say there’s ~1/5 (20%) chance that a PIN creates a Tetrino.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="math"/><category term="stats"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A quick story to explain the concept:]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Toybaru - Porsche Killer</title><link href="https://xeroblaze0.github.io/blog/2024/car/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Toybaru - Porsche Killer"/><published>2024-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-01-19T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://xeroblaze0.github.io/blog/2024/car</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://xeroblaze0.github.io/blog/2024/car/"><![CDATA[ <hr/> <h2 id="history">History</h2> <div class="img_row"> <img class="col three" src="/assets/car/car_01.jpeg"/> </div> <p><br/></p> <p>In 2015 I bought a Scion FRS, still under warranty with 38k miles on it.

The game is played in hands with players discarding into a crib that alternates between counting towards each player’s score. Points are gained through card combinations in their hand and card combinations from play. The first player to 121 wins. It’s a great game to geek out on.</p> <div class="img_row"> <img class="col three" src="/assets/cribbage/Untitled.jpeg"/> </div> <p><br/></p> <h3 id="stats-gone-mad">Stats Gone Mad</h3> <p>I started with a python framework from <a href="https://github.com/jonathanmcmahon/cribbage">Github</a>. This repo seemed like a good base to start from; a few other people started from it and even corrected a scoring bug. A couple of interesting things to note: first, the deck is a object made of two dictionaries, one of suits and one of ranks, and the deck itself is a list of card objects. There’s a couple of deck-specific functions built into the class, like draw() and shuffle(). There’s two built in players, one a user controls, the other random. The random player uses no analysis for cribbing or playing cards but does provide an example of what the program expects.</p> <p>AI: Cribbage is a great game for stats and the nauances can make or break a game by a point. Every move and decision carries weight, and the tiniest details can spell the difference between triumph and defeat. Cribbage challenges players to master the art of precision and calculation. Whether it’s analyzing the probability of a winning hand or strategically discarding cards, the thrill lies not only in the gameplay itself, but also in the endless possibilities for statistical exploration and strategic decision-making.</p> <h3 id="building-out-the-cpu-player">Building out the CPU Player</h3> <p>The first thing I wanted to tackle was the decision process for discarding to the crib. The situation is static and really where all the analysis fun is. I started with evaluating starter card options. The program iterates through each hand + starter combination and tally’s up the hand score:</p> <div class="img_row"> <img class="col three" src="/assets/cribbage/Figure_01.png"/> </div> <p>In this instance we can see any 4 card combo-ing nicely with the pair of 5’s and the 6, for two 3-card straights and two 15’s. Likewise, 5’s 7’s and 9’s receive the same score through three-of-a-kind, straights, and combos of 15, respectively. This scenarios is 1 of 46 within 14 other possible hand combinations.</p> <h4 id="strategy">Strategy</h4> <p>The latitude by which one hand can vary provides a great field to “play ball” in. For instance if we look at the fact that 5, 7, and 9 would all provide the same score, they do not have the same likelihood of occuring. Our hand already has two 5’s so pulling another 5 is 2 in 46 (4.34%), while a 7 or 9 is twice as likely to occur with 4 in 46 (8.70%). Similarly 4 provides us with the highest score and has a 4 in 46 chance of occuring, however, every face card is also unaccounted for and (including the 10’s) has a 16 in 42 chance of occuring, almost 1 in 3. Amazing. What do these differences in scoring and likelihood mean?</p> <p>Well, we’ve really asked ourselves three-ish questions; what is the top score, what is the most probable, and what is the average?</p> <div class="img_row"> <img class="col three" src="/assets/cribbage/Figure_03.png"/> </div> <p>I consolidated the data into three 3D symmetrical graphs. They are symmetrical along the diagonal because you can’t discard a card you’ve already discarded. Behind the scenes I used permutations of each hand rather than combinations because it made the math behind the scenes easier.</p> <ul> <li>The <i>top score</i> is probably the easiest to understand. It’s the most optimistic, the “ooo, if I just get this card I win the game” mentality, but often not very likely to happen.</li> <li>The <i>most probable score</i> is the score you’ll most likely receive. As mentioned before all face cards (and 10’s) have a value of 10, meaning there are 16 cards with a value of 10, as opposed to just 4. Your most likely score will bias towards what those higher cards will give you, simply because there’s more higher value cards.</li> <li>The <i>average score</i> fills in the gap between top score and most likely, what I call a soft indicator of hand strength. It averages score across all combinations of hand and starter.</li> </ul> <p>Some of the math requires estimating the potential crib hand, which is unknowable. We can either disregard it or dive whole hog into stats, so lets get the wet suit on. <a href="http://www.cribbageforum.com/YourCrib.htm#addition">Discard tables</a> indicate the average number of points a crib will be worth if you discard a particular two-card combination and I included four in the program; Hessel, Colvert, Rasmussen, and Schell. Rasmussen is unique in that it was compiled using real world games rather than computer simulations. This helps capture some of the nuances and counter-plays that aren’t obvious even in play. The tables don’t agree on every detail — the composition of any crib is the result of a decision by two independent players, so it is impossible to arrive at absolute numbers. But taken together, they paint a good picture of what you can actually expect in your games.</p> <h3 id="outro--future-work">Outro &amp; Future Work</h3> <p>There’s a lot of places you can go armed with this information and a lot of different ways to play the game, but this is how I wrapped it up:</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">return crib_permus[np.argmax(score_aves)]</code></p> <p>This returns the discard combo with the highest average score. The <i>top score</i> approach is too much of a silver bullet to be viable, and the <i>most likely</i> approach generally gives low scores (go figure). Highest average score does a good chunk of the leg work. Here’s test run against the RandomCPU player:</p> <div class="img_row"> <img class="col three" src="/assets/cribbage/Figure_04.png"/> </div> <p><br/> Winner!</p> <p>Future work would complete the other half of cribbage gameplay, pegging. Crib discard is a lot of stat analysis, graphing, and overall strategy of the hand. Pegging on the otherhand is all tactic, but necessarily depends on the discard. There are a few guidelines and situations to follow but it should be a degree more straight-forward than crib analysis.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="math"/><category term="stats"/><category term="python"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Cribbage]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Design Principals for NHP Laboratory Animals</title><link href="https://xeroblaze0.github.io/blog/2022/monkey_toys/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Design Principals for NHP Laboratory Animals"/><published>2022-11-21T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2022-11-21T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://xeroblaze0.github.io/blog/2022/monkey_toys</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://xeroblaze0.github.io/blog/2022/monkey_toys/"><![CDATA[<h2 id="naxos-labs">Naxos Labs</h2> <p>In collaboration with a veterinarian, we started a company that designed a range of toys specifically tailored for NHPs and other laboratory animals.

The use of subtle patterns and the absence of any intricate details draw the eye’s attention to outliers that serve as guides while using the toys, while the rounded corners and edges created a visually cohesive and gentle appearance. The goal was for the toys to be inviting and self-explanatory, with additional features and game rules revealed through play and exploration.</p> <div class="img_row"> <img class="col three" src="/assets/monkey/gif/00-2.gif"/> </div> <p>Likewise, we also considered the time and labor constraints of the technicians and handlers who’d also work with the toys. To address this, we added intuitive quality of life features to make the toys more user-friendly and streamline their effort.</p> <h3 id="production-matters">Production Matters</h3> <p>We opted for the Prusa Mk3S 3D printers to manufacture the toys, enabling us to rapidly iterate on designs and materials. To enhance functionality, we upgraded the printers with 32-bit Raspberry Pi control boards and firmware, enabling remote printing, multi-printer management, and advanced control options. Additionally, we equipped the printers with tungsten coated heat breaks and nozzles which offer a heat-resistant and low-friction surface as a replacement for the typical PTFE tube.</p> <p>We experimented with various materials and infills (PLA, PETG, TPU, wood, PC) but in the end landed on PLA. PETG was also on the brittle side for our use-case. ABS and ASA were contenders but PLA ended up being more compatible. PLA can be recycled, is (industrially) compostable, but ultimately won out because our vendor could verify that it was food-safe.</p> <h3 id="future-ideas">Future Ideas</h3> <p>Looking ahead there are several areas I would’ve like to have focused on. First, I would’ve developed a traceable QR code that’d be embossed on each toy.

This makes mounting the sensors easy in a small space while also simplifying the design. Below is an early shot of the foldable layout.</p> <p> <center><img src="/assets/enviro_sensor/img/foldy_face.png" width="80%;" height="100%;" alt=""/> <br/> <em>Figure 1: 3D model of enclosure</em></center> </p> <h2 id="control">Control</h2> <p>A few libraries need to be included for the sensors to operate. I found Adafruit’s display library easier to use than DFRobot’s. Some of the sensors need to be initialized beforehand, notably the VOC. It’s recommended that it run for 30 mins while in use. “This is because the sensitivity levels of the sensor will change during early use and the resistance will slowly rise over time as the MOX warms up to its baseline reading.” - <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bme680-humidity-temperature-barometic-pressure-voc-gas/overview">Adafruit BME680 Overview</a>. For this reasion, the device has a 5 minute warm-up period before displaying VOC data.</p> <blockquote> <p>` bme.setGasHeater(320, 150); // 320*C for 150 ms`</p> </blockquote> <p>Likewise, the TSL2591 has a special initialization parameters:</p> <blockquote> <p>` void configureTSL2591(void){`</p> <p>` tsl.setGain(TSL2591_GAIN_MED); // 25x gain<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> </code> tsl.setTiming(TSL2591_INTEGRATIONTIME_300MS);<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> </code> tsl2591Gain_t gain = tsl.getGain();`</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">}</code></p> </blockquote> <p>The controller assumes the TSL2591 and the APDS9960 have the same spectral response. First, the TSL2591 has two photodiodes: Visible spectrum + Infrared (VS+IR) response, and Infrared (IR) response. Subtracting the IR photodiode activity from the VS+IR activity leaves visible light. See Figure 2, left.</p> <p>Spectral responses are different, but similar enough to each other for this trick to work. The ADPS9960 might exhibit more activity towards the lowered end of the spectrum. Even though we’re strictly using the RGB channels, this will present a slight bias towards blue later in the project.</p> <div class="img_row"> <img class="col two" src="/assets/enviro_sensor/img/tsl2591_spectrum.png"/> <img class="col two" src="/assets/enviro_sensor/img/apds9960_spectrum.png" style="float: right"/> </div> <div class="col three caption"> Figure 2: left, TSL2591 spectral response; right, onboard APDS9960 spectral response </div> <p>The GUVA UV wavelength response is ~240-380nm, just out of reach of the APDS9960.

Pneumatic systems use air as a working fluid. The piston is 3D printed using PLA polymer and is attached to an air compressor for pneumatic action. System is controlled using a PIC32 microcontroller and communicates serially with a computer. Two varaints of the piston were developed: a pneumatic return and a spring return.

Adjusting the pressure changes the speed and force in which the piston actuates.</p> <p>The PIC32 is a 32 bit, general purpose, microcontroller. It acts as the brains of the system, listening to the pressure sensors and directing the pressure regulator. It can also recognize when the probe has touched the fingertip. Real time system information is displayed on the screen and transmitted serially to a listening computer.</p> <p> <center> <img src="/assets/mri/gif/mri_sideXside_left.gif" width="40%;" height="100%;" style="margin-right:50px;"/> <img src="/assets/mri/gif/mri_sideXside_right.gif" width="40%;" height="100%;"/> <br/> <em>Figure 6: Actuating piston</em> </center> </p> <hr/> <h2 id="discussion--future-work">Discussion &amp; Future Work</h2> <p>During development I made it a priority that the device was MRI-compatible, which influenced many of the design considerations and challenges. The decision to use a pneumatic system made it so there is no interference from the apparatus during the MR imaging process. However, air is a compressible fluid which makes it difficult to control. A hydraulic system was considered to address that but was never implemented due to concerns about leakage.</p> <p>That said, leakage still proved to be a nuisance throughout the project. Pistons of various sizes were printed in an effort to dial in the tolerances, but ultimately will require better surface finishing. In addition to O-Rings, piston rod rings were incorporated into the design to alleviate the issue. Though not unsuccessful, it was not utilized in the final design.</p> <p>The control loop has two pressure sensors and one touch sensor. An optical linear encoder using fiber optic cables was considered, which would’ve provided more certain feedback of the piston, but ultimately was shelved due to time constraints.</p> <p>Moving forward, our project will focus on enhancing the robustness of each component and establishing a solid framework for development, as well as actuator characterization and precise interaction with the finger. Currently, our controller leverages the CTMU module on the PIC32. To ensure its functionality, the surface that the fingertip comes into contact with must be both conductive and MRI-compatible, such as aluminum foil. Studies examining the heating effects of MRI scanning have shown that no significant heating (burning) occurs with nonferromagnetic materials.<sup><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/mrm.1910070302?sid=nlm%3Apubmed">[2]</a></sup> There is also no risk of interference caused by motion<sup><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18982643/">[3]</a></sup>.</p> <h2 id="more-information">More Information</h2> <p>More information and details specific to the project, please see my Github link <a href="https://github.com/alexanderhay2020/499_pneumatic">here</a>.</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <p>[1] Purves, D., Augustine, G., Fitzpatrick, D., Hall, W., LaMantia, A., Mooney, R., Platt, M. and White, L., 2018.

This post demos how to use some of the tools FIJI has, including data collection techniques.</p> <h3 id="initial-data">Initial Data</h3> <div class="img_row"> <img class="col three" src="/assets/fiji/SACs_color.png"/> </div> <div class="col three caption"> Figure 1: Original image </div> <p>The image for this demo is of starburst amacrine cells (SACs), interneurons in the retina. The image is a single channel .tif, 512x512 pixels, with each pixel representing 0.62 microns. With this information we definitively measure how big each cell is.</p> <h4 id="brightness--contrast">Brightness &amp; Contrast</h4> <p>The first thing I do is adjust the brightness and contrast. By looking at the histogram we can see that the image is very dark, more dark than it needs to be. Lowering the maximum value fills out the range of present colors. The difference is clear in Figure 2.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/fiji/fig_02a-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/fiji/fig_02a-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/fiji/fig_02a-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/fiji/fig_02a.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/fiji/fig_02b-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/fiji/fig_02b-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/fiji/fig_02b-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/fiji/fig_02b.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 2: left, unaltered maximum; right, fitted maximum </div> <p>It’s important in this step to not over-saturate the image by raising or lowering the minimum/maximum values. This step is to present the information within the image as a whole. Tweaking and refining will come later.</p> <p>For this demo I want to look at the cells, not the nebulous background or nodelets. Given that, the image doesn’t need to be as bright. However, it’s important to note that brightening the image revealed more cells and provided better definition. Where this middle ground is depends on the observer and whatever their interests are.</p> <h4 id="threshold">Threshold</h4> <p>Thresholding is an important first step in many image analysis techniques. It converts the image to a black and white image. Here I adjust the histogram in the same fashion as before and focus it around the peak. That filters out the background while keeping true to the cell size and shape.</p> <div class="img_row"> <img class="col three" src="/assets/fiji/fig_03.png"/> </div> <div class="col three caption"> Figure 3: Initial image after apply the threshold. Note, adjusting for a dark background flips the histogram values </div> <p>Sometimes after adjusting the image, the subject matter may blend together. In this case applying the threshold created some peanut shaped objects. Watershed segmentation addresses the issue and cuts the “peanut” in half. Figure 4 highlights the effect.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/fiji/fig_04a-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/fiji/fig_04a-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/fiji/fig_04a-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/fiji/fig_04a.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/fiji/fig_04b-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/fiji/fig_04b-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/fiji/fig_04b-1400.webp"/> <img src="/assets/fiji/fig_04b.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Figure 4: Left, pre-watershed; Right, post-watershed </div> <h4 id="analyzing-the-image">Analyzing the Image</h4> <p>This is where the magic happens. Once the cells are properly individualized we can count and measure each cell. FIJI automatically does this. Since I’m interested in the size and position of the cells I’ve excluded any cells that are cropped by the edge. From here the data is exported to a .csv file.</p> <div class="img_row"> <img class="col three" src="/assets/fiji/fig_05.png"/> </div> <div class="col three caption"> Figure 5: FIJI can automatically count and size each cell. </div> <h3 id="matlab">MATLAB</h3> <p>The exported data contains a cell ID, area, and x/y position. First, I want to determine if the size of the cells fits any distribution. The Jarque-Bera Test tests the normality of a dataset and MATLAB has a built in function for this. Applying the JB test to the data gives a result of 1, meaning that the test rejects the hypothesis that the data (cell size) is normally distributed.</p> <p>We can also look at the nearest neighbor of each cell (see Figure 6).</p> <div class="img_row"> <img class="col three" src="/assets/fiji/fig_06.png"/> </div> <div class="col three caption"> Figure 6: Looking at each cell's nearest neighbor </div> <p>So the size of the cells aren’t interesting, but what about the spatial distribution of the cells? Using the data provided by the image, we can calculate the coefficient of variation:</p> <p>μ = 21.0440</p> <p>σ = 5.3968</p> <p>CoV = σ/μ = 0.26</p> <p>(units are in microns)</p> <p>Defining λ as the average distance of the nearest neighbor (21.0440), the Poisson coefficient of variation is:</p> <p>CoV = λ^(-1/2) = 0.22</p> <p>A Poisson distribution assumes that cells are “blind” to each other’s positions as they develop and can’t occupy the same space. The fact that these coefficients are close infers that these SACs are also blind as they develop.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="biology"/><category term="neuroscience"/><category term="stats"/><category term="matlab"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using FIJI/ImageJ to analyze cell populations]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Principal Component Analysis</title><link href="https://xeroblaze0.github.io/blog/2020/principal_component_analysis/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Principal Component Analysis"/><published>2020-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2020-05-13T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://xeroblaze0.github.io/blog/2020/principal_component_analysis</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://xeroblaze0.github.io/blog/2020/principal_component_analysis/"><![CDATA[<p> <a href=""></a><div class=""></div> <a href="https://github.com/alexanderhay2020/408/blob/master/hw/hw5/homework5.m"><div class="color-button">GitHub</div></a> </p> <h3 id="neuron-anatomy">Neuron Anatomy</h3> <p>Neurons generally have four functional regions; input, integration, conduction, and output. Inputs are generated current flowing in and out of the cell. Inputs are aggregated, and if triggered, generate an action potential and releasing neurotransmitters. In this exercise I examine the intracellular activity of a cell and determine how many presynaptic cells are providing an input, as well as the activity level of each input.</p> <div class="img_row"> <img class="col three" src="/assets/pca/fig_01.png"/> </div> <div class="col three caption"> Figure 1: General functional regions of the neuron </div> <h3 id="initial-data">Initial Data</h3> <p>To visualize the data I plotted it as a heat map.

The actuators used in this project are made with Nitinol, an SMA with a 1:1 Nickel-Titanium ratio. These alloys have a transition temperature and easily deform when below this temperature. The crystalline structure shifts but does not suffer permanent damage (C-&gt;A). Once the wire is heated above the transition temperature the crystals undergo a phase change and revert back to their original structure, with a large force (A-&gt;B). When the wire cools again the phase change reverses and the wire can be deformed again (B-&gt;C).</p> <p> <center><img src="/assets/sma/Figure_3-2.jpg" width="50%;" height="50%;" alt=""/> <br/> <em>Diagram showing how SMAs atomic structure deforms</em></center> </p> <p>As a wire, this deformation manifests as a change of length in the wire. For the actuators to actuate, a current is passed through the wire. The internal resistance of the wire heats it up above its transition temperature, instigating the phase change and <em>contraction</em> and creating a pulling force.</p> <h3 id="equilibrium-point-control">Equilibrium Point Control</h3> <p>Equilibrium point control (EPC) is motor control through changing muscle stiffness. A ‘reciprocal command’ is sent to shift the equilibrium point, moving the limb. In the λ‐model of motor control, proposed by Feldman<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15136283?dopt=Abstract">[1]</a><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2342993/">[2]</a></sup>, the reciprocal command, alters the relative activation of agonist and antagonist muscles to produce a shift in the equilibrium between the muscle force and external load. While it has fallen out of vogue in human motor control, this project explores using it as a means of actuation of SMAs.</p> <p> <center><img src="/assets/sma/alpha_model.png" width="100%;" height="100%;" alt=""/> <br/> <em>α model: motor control through changing muscle stiffness</em></center> </p> <h3 id="actuator">Actuator</h3> <p>The Miga T220 SMA linear actuator was chosen for this project.

I used Solidworks for part models, assembly, and drawings. The frame was built from acrylic cut from a laser cutter, special screws and couplings were printed using the Ultimaker3 3D printer. Plastic hardware bits are required for stacking the actuators, as the mounting holes are part of the circuit.</p> <p>For the presentation at the Museum of Science and Industry, two (2) of the Miga actuators were removed and the fans repositioned to directly face the actuators.

A λ-model could be modeled by installing a position sensor on the actuator or a rotary encoder at the joint, sending the muscle property data that the muscle spindle broadcasts. A PID controller could then be implemented to give the actuators a spring-like quality that is seen in muscle fibers<sup><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8930238">[3]</a></sup>.</p> <p>Future work would also involve building out the “forearm”.
